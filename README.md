## Introduction

The **Avicenna project** integrates biosignal data analysis with an AI-driven chatbot to provide insights into users' cognitive load and emotional well-being. The project comprises two main components: a **dashboard** for real-time data collection and analysis, and a **chatbot** for personalized feedback. This report primarily focuses on the dashboard development and data analysis conducted by **Kamran Asad Al Aziz**, while briefly touching upon the chatbot integration by **Mirshoir**.

The chatbot component of the Avicenna project was designed to provide personalized insights and recommendations based on the user’s cognitive load and stress levels. Below are the functionalities of the `chatbot.py` module:

### Features
1. **Conversational Interface**:
   - The chatbot interacts with users, understanding their concerns and providing relevant feedback.
2. **Integration with Dashboard**:
   - Fetches cognitive load metrics and stress analysis results from the dashboard.
3. **AI Models Used**:
   - Leveraged LLaMA and Ollama's Mistral models for robust conversational capabilities.
4. **Personalized Feedback**:
   - Offers tailored advice on stress management and improving focus.

### Technologies Used
- **Streamlit** for seamless integration with the dashboard.
- **Custom NLP Models** for accurate sentiment analysis and response generation.
- **PyTorch** for deploying the LLaMA model.

Sample Chatbot Functionality Code Snippet:
```python
import streamlit as st

def chatbot_interface():
    st.title("Avicenna Chatbot")
    user_input = st.text_input("How can I assist you today?")
    if user_input:
        response = generate_response(user_input)
        st.write("Chatbot:", response)

def generate_response(user_input):
    # Placeholder for AI model integration
    return "I am here to assist you with your cognitive load insights."

if __name__ == "__main__":
    chatbot_interface()
```
